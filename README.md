# Operator Form & Customer Page (Next.js + MUI)

This project is a modern, responsive web app built with Next.js and Material-UI (MUI). It is designed for tour operators or travel agencies (like [tours.co.th](https://tours.co.th)) to quickly collect and confirm booking details in a beautiful, user-friendly way.

## What is this?

- **Operator Form**: A web form for entering booking details: booking number, program, name, tour date, hotel, phone, address options, PAX (adults, children, infants), cash on tour, and national park fee. Instantly generates a confirmation message you can copy/share. Automatically copies the confirmation to your clipboard after submit.
- **Customer Page**: A dedicated form for customer booking confirmation. Enter tour date, name, pick up, pickup time (from/to), and optionally FEE Adult/Child fields. Instantly preview and copy a formatted confirmation email. Toggle FEE fields by clicking "With Fee". Designed for quick, accurate customer communication.
- **Persistent Side Menu**: Easily navigate between Operator Form and Customer pages using the always-visible (desktop) or toggleable (mobile) side menu.
- **PWA (Progressive Web App) Support**: Install this app on your device for a native-like experience. Works offline and can be added to your home screen on mobile and desktop.
- Fully responsive and easy to use on any device.
- Built and iterated **super fast and easily with the help of this AI assistant ([\@cursor](https://github.com/getcursor/cursor))**

## PWA Features

- **Installable**: Click the install prompt in your browser (or "Add to Home Screen" on mobile) to install the app like a native app.
- **Offline support**: The app works offline after the first load, thanks to service worker caching.
- **Home screen icon**: Custom icon and splash screen for a professional look.
- **Fast loading**: Instant startup from your device, even without a network connection.
