# Operator Form (Next.js + MUI)

This project is a modern, responsive operator form built with Next.js and Material-UI (MUI). It is designed for tour operators or travel agencies (like [tours.co.th](https://tours.co.th)) to quickly collect and confirm booking details in a beautiful, user-friendly way.

## What is this?

- A web form for entering booking details: booking number, program, name, tour date, hotel, phone, address options, PAX (adults, children, infants), cash on tour, and national park fee.
- Instantly generates a confirmation message you can copy/share.
- Automatically copies the confirmation to your clipboard after submit.
- Fully responsive and easy to use on any device.
- Built and iterated **super fast and easily with the help of this AI assistant ([\@cursor](https://github.com/getcursor/cursor))**
